# SteadyComPy
A cobrapy-based implementation of SteadyCom, the algorithm from:

Chan SHJ, Simons MN, Maranas CD (2017) SteadyCom: Predicting microbial abundances while ensuring community stability. PLoS Comput Biol 13(5): e1005539. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005539

For the original MATLAB implementation, see https://github.com/maranasgroup/SteadyCom. The MATLAB implementation is also directly available in the MATLAB-based COBRA toolbox as of July 26th, 2017.

This python implementation is a work in progress, and will serve as a template to make it easier to implement the algorithm in dedicated community modeling packages that use cobrapy.
